Abstract
========

Optional type hints were introduced to the Python language in PEP 484
[#pep484]_, based on the function annotation syntax from PEP 3107
[#pep3107]_. PEP 484 also introduced *type stubs*, also called *stub files*,
that provide type information for untyped Python packages and modules. Type
stubs serve multiple purposes:

* They are the only way to add type information to extension modules.
* They can provide type information for packages that do not wish to
  add them inline.
* They can be distributed separately from the implementation.
  This allows stubs to be develped at a different pace or by different
  authors, which is especially useful when adding type annotations to
  existing packages.
* They act as documentation, succinctly explaining the external
  API of a package, without including the implementation or private
  members.

This PEP aims to give guidance to both authors of type stubs and developers
of type checkers. It describes the contents of compliant type stubs,
suggests a style guide for them, and lists constructs that compliant type
checkers are expected to support.

A type stub is considered to be compliant if it only uses constructs decribed
in this PEP. Type stub authors can elect to use additional constructs, but
must be prepared that some type checkers will not parse them as expected.

A type checker is considered to be compliant if
it accepts all compliant type stubs. This means it
will parse a compliant type stub without error and does not interpret any
construct in a contradictory manner. A compliant type checker is not
required to interpret all standard constructs, and additionally a type checker
can support extra constructs not described in this PEP. All deviations from
this PEP should be documented.

Syntax
======

Type stubs are syntactically valid Python files with a ``.pyi`` suffix.
They should be valid according to the latest Python version six months
after release at the latest, but can start to use features from that
release from the release date on.
Type stubs authors are encouraged to use the latest available syntax
features in stubs, even if the type information in the stub is targeted
to an older Python version.

Type checkers are expected to support the syntax of the latest released Python
version.

For example, Python 3.7, which enabled the new keywords `async`
and `await` (see [#pep492]_), was released on June 27nd, 2018. Type
checkers should support them by that date and type stubs could start
using `async` to mark function definitions. On the other hand, type stubs
should stop using the new keyword as an attribute or function name before
December 27nd, 2018.

Distribution
============

Type stubs can be distributed separately from the implementation;
see PEP 561 [#pep561]_ for more information. The typeshed_ project
includes stubs for Python's standard library and several third-party
packages. These are usually distributed with type checkers and do not
require separate installation.
